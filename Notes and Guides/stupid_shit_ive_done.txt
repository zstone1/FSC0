Here are some fun thing I've lost time to

The correct file extention is ".idr". It's not ".Idr" or "ird". 

The idris installer works. Use "idris -p Lightyear" to load the Lightyear
module. Do not use "idris -p lightyear". 

vimscript isn't that hard. It's wierd, but it's easy enough to edit plugins. 

File hierarchy is linked to import statements.

When buildling files in idris, ibc files are by default placed adjacent to the
file. This is not optimal. What works better is to use the --ibcsubdir flag
when starting up idris to set a directory for all of the built files. It is
finicky, but it works when using a reasonable hierarchay of projects, and
explicit references to all imports, relative to a root file.
