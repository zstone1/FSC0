Here are some fun thing I've lost time to

The correct file extention is ".idr". It's not ".Idr" or "ird". 

The idris installer works. Use "idris -p Lightyear" to load the Lightyear
module. Do not use "idris -p lightyear". 

vimscript isn't that hard. It's wierd, but it's easy enough to edit plugins. 

File hierarchy is linked to import statements.
